# Detection-of-Displastic-Features-in-Oral-Histology
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to detect Displastic Features in Oral Histology.
The model is trained on a dataset of Normal vs OSCC images
A UI is created using streamlit showing a GRADCAM heatmap of displastic features and the Model Performance Metrics when the user inputs an image of histological slide
